		<p style=" padding: 20px;">
			Duke Rowan Stonehearth II inherited his position from his father 34 years ago. Though he has final say, the Duke allows the city of Ostenwall to be ran by a council of nobles.
			<br /><br />
			Eris Ravenfall is the aggressively self appointed leader of the merchant guilds in Ostenwall. A nice enough woman when you are not in her way, but a shrewd businesswoman. Does not shy away from having someone murdered, hence Cassius' former employment.
			<br /><br />
			Cassius is the former assassin/bodyguard to Eris Ravenfall. He eventually had a change of heart and retired to Thorngate.
			<br /><br />
			Baron Gabriel Archeon: The Now head of the Archeon House and member of the Ostenwall council. Baron Gabriel Archeon is a tall, and well built man, with dark skin and black hair. Winning the favor of lady Eve during his time as a tournament Jouster. He has proven to be a competent military leader, and without his on the fly thinking, would have made the disaster at the battle of Blackrock Pass a total a irrecoverable disaster. While he is a competent, if not great military leader his statecraft is much to be desired, leading him to be seen in the courts as a stiff individual.

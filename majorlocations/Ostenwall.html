			Ostenwall is the capital of (kingdom in Myrellian Concordance?) ruled by duke Rowan Stonehearth II, but is primarily run by a council of nobles.
			<br /><br />
			Ostenwall sits in the middle of a valley among the Venval mountain range with a small patch of forest to the north.

		<p style=" padding: 20px;">
			Duke Rowan Stonehearth II inherited his position from his father 34 years ago. Though he has final say, the Duke allows the city of Ostenwall to be ran by a council of nobles.
			<br /><br />
			Eris Ravenfall is the aggressively self appointed leader of the merchant guilds in Ostenwall. A nice enough woman when you are not in her way, but a shrewd businesswoman. Does not shy away from having someone murdered, hence Cassius' former employment.
			<br /><br />
			Cassius is the former assassin/bodyguard to Eris Ravenfall. He eventually had a change of heart and retired to Thorngate.

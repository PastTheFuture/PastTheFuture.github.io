		<p style=" padding: 20px;">
			Thorngate is the principle settlement of the West Marches at the beginning of your adventures, and the farthest flung outpost of the Old Alliance, now the Myrellian Concordance. It was established as an observation and staging point for Alliance armies during the Ashen Wars. After the Rose Accord was signed and the Darmoran Empire collapsed, Thorngate has become a largely independent "city-state", though it still follows Myrellian laws and customs.
			<br /><br />
			A small town with a population of about three thousand individuals, Thorngate is protected on three sides by a low wall of crumbling masonry. Patches of moss compete for space with crawling ivy and blooming rose bushes. The northern side of town is nestled in to a steep, rocky hill, and built into the base of this hill is Thorndawn Keep. The castle is in an equal state of disrepair as the walls, if not greater; Thorngate has not come under serious attack in more than thirty years. Thorngate's police force and first line of defense are the Knights of the Rose, also called the Rose Guard, or simply as "Pricks" by more ungrateful citizens. These guards typically wear green-dyed gambesons and patrol the crooked streets of town armed with halberds or studded truncheons, always on the alert for trouble-makers and lawbreakers. Considering the nature of Thorndawn Keep, the Knights of the Rose headquarter in a fortified barracks attached to Town Hall, referred to as "the Hedge" by most locals.
			<br /><br />
			Thorngate is a frontier town, at the very end of the western trade route. Merchant caravans arrive in Thorngate to buy cheap furs, ore, lumber, and reagents, mostly dropping off alcohol and mercenaries in addition to other luxuries and commodities. The town's population is about two-thirds human, but the rest of the population is relatively cosmopolitan. Many half-orcs, half-elves, tieflings, and other races considered outcasts by society have made this far flung outpost their home.
			While Knight-Commander Meribeth Vestellion is ostensibly the governor of Thorngate, she and the other Knights of the Rose concern themselves mainly with protecting the town from outlaws and breaking up fights between drunks. Most of the town's civil infrastructure is largely managed by a rotating council of merchants and local "concerned factors." These business-minded individuals encourage trade and growth between Thorngate, eastern caravans, and their distant contacts in the West Marches. The only permanent members of this council are Durrekkin Steelheart and Jezeera the Arcane.

			Durrekkin, a grizzled mountain dwarf from his homeclan, manages Western Steel, the town's armory and only major forge; he and his apprentices are responsible for maintaining the Rose Guard's armaments, but also supplying mercenaries and adventurers with basic equipment.
			<br /><br />
			Jezeera, known as the Arcane, is Thorngate's resident wizard. A woman of unknown racial origin, some claim she is a half-elf, an aasimar, a tiefling, or even a fallen angel. She's been here since Thorngate was founded nearly a hundred years ago, and hasn't aged a day. Most of her time is spent running a relic dealing business, buying and selling mysterious and even eldritch artifacts recovered from the ruins and battlefields of the West Marches to curious collectors from the east, or adventurers trying to gain and edge or make a coin. On more than one occasion, Jezeera has used her awesome powers to defend the town from marauding Wartorn, ogres, gnolls, and even a young green dragon. Additionally, every burglar and dare-devil who has attempted to steal her valuables has met a gruesome end. Despite this long life of hardships, the locals seem to adore and tolerate her many eccentricities.

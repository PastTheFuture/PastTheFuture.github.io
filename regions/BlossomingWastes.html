		<p style=" padding: 20px;">For most newcomers to the West Marches, the Blossoming Wastes are the first (And last) region they'll experience. They were once verdant grasslands bounded by ranges of rolling hills, populated by massive herd animals and nomadic tribes. But that was before several decades of internecine warfare, intense battle magic, unbound outsiders, and alchemical pollution. Now the landscape is scarred and torn, a bright and terrible beauty. Forests of gigantic, technicolor mushrooms and flowers shelter mutated bees and spiders. Goblins lurk in huge bramble patches, ducking under thorns like swords. Abandoned strongholds and watchtowers collapse under the strain of sinister roots, darkened by a haze of green and yellow mist. Wartorn bandits, shackled demons, and mournful undead haunt these ruins, waiting for the unlucky and unwary. Some parts of the Blossoming Wastes are still relatively unmarred, but riotous with unusually colored wildflowers and grasses.</p>

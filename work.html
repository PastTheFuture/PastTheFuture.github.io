				<p>Below are some programs I made while working at Digital Dynamics Inc.</p>
				<p>Note: screenshots of some programs have been blurred as they may contain confidential information.</p>
				<h2>Main Project:</h2>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="media/work/OmnitechB.png"><img src="media/work/OmnitechB.png" alt="A screenshot of printing some kits in Omnitech"></a></div>
				<h3>Omnitech</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omnitech is a collection of a number of different smaller projects that I decided would work better together. It's main purpose was to provide easy management and overview of my work.<p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program lists all currently relevant jobs, their printed and completed status, as well as some notes. The user can then select whichever jobs and print the part lists for each. Before I wrote this program, printing new jobs with the stock management software we were using was a 20 minute process rife with human error, but with Omnitech it is just a few mouse clicks and then waiting for it to print.</p>

				<h2>Smaller Projects</h2>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="media/work/SQLBrowser.png"><img src="media/work/SQLBrowser.png" alt="A screenshot of searching for some parts in SQLBrowser"></a></div>
				<h3>SQLBrowser</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I later discovered that similar programs already existed, I made SQLBrowser to easily and quickly rummage through the datatables of our stock management software.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after discovering alternatives, I would still use the program due to it being simpler and faster. </p>
				
				<br class="clear"><br>
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="media/work/PartFinder.png"><img src="media/work/PartFinder.png" alt="A screenshot of searching for a particular part on a board."></a></div>
				<h3>PartFinder</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes someone would hand me a finished product and point to a part on it and ask for another one. Though I knew many of our parts, it was next to impossible to know all of them. So I created this part finding program to find a part based on its narration code (in other words location) on a product. </p>
				
				<br class="clear"><br>
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="media/work/LabelMakerA.png"><img src="media/work/LabelMakerA.png" alt="A screenshot of creating a label sheet for some part bins."></a></div>
				<h3>LabelMaker</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would often get new parts in for the stockroom, and each one needed its own bin with a label to describe it. These sheets were very tedious to fill out by hand in word so I wrote this LabelMaker program to automatically get the parts description from the datatables and even create a barcode for them!</p>

				<h2>Non-Work related Programming</h2>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><video width="250" height="250" controls><source src="https://i.imgur.com/r7dhG9U.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> </div>
				<h3>Strategy Game</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest game I have been developing. A turn-based party strategy game.</p>
				<br class="clear"><br>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><video width="250" height="250" controls><source src="https://i.imgur.com/k2zfMur.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> </div>
				<h3>Minigun Demo</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt inspired one day and created this demo of firing a minigun.</p>
				<br class="clear"><br>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/siege-ballista"><img src="media/work/SiegeBallista.png" alt="A siege ballista mod I made.."></a></div>
				<h3>Siege Ballista Mod</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mod I made that introduces a siege ballista into the base-building game Factorio. Click the image to visit the mod page.</p>
				<br class="clear"><br>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="media/work/Boats.png"><img src="media/work/Boats.png" alt="A screenshot of firing canon balls from a ship."></a></div>
				<h3>Boats</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created this multiplayer boat game where up to four people can try to be the first to sink everyone elses ships! </p>
				<br class="clear"><br>
				
				<div class="gamePic"><a href="media/work/Starfield.png"><img src="media/work/Starfield.png" alt="A screenshot of my live desktop background application."></a></div>
				<h3>Desktop Background</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had always wanted to have the old windows starfield screensaver as a desktop background and since I didn't have much luck finding any software to do it (at the time) I decided to try my hand at making it myself. It can also do other things such as play pong by itself and loop a gif. I didn't end up using it much as it turned out a bit clunky and took too much system resources. This program is available on my <a href="https://github.com/PastTheFuture/DesktopBackground">Github</a></p>

			<h3>Yir, Light Domain</h3>
			<p>The first deity, wearing an ivory mask and cloaked in shadows, appeared in the formless Void at the beginning of time. A being of pure will and innocent might, they saw the nameless horrors crawling in the darkness and decided that something must be done about them. First, it needed a name to combat the unknown. Yir was the name they decided upon. After some contemplation, they decided to arm themselves with light to combat the darkness. A long lance of white, glowing with silver fire, appeared in their left hand. On their right arm, a shield of searing flame, shining with a fierce orange radiance. With these tools, Yir was able to drive back the darkness; it fled howling to the very corners of creation.</p>
			<p>For now, Yir was content, and decided that they had earned a rest. For its shade and sweet fruit, they first conjured a plum tree to rest under. Beside the plum tree flowed a sparkling stream, its musical tinkling lulling Yir to sleep. Satisfied yet tired, Yir rested soundly. Their shield leaned against the trunk of the plum tree, sending up swirling orange motes in to its branches. At their feet was their lance, catching the light of the river and reflecting it out in to the shrinking void a thousandfold. As Yir slept, their mind worked, dreamstuff weaving the next steps of creation.</p>
			<p>Yir is the twofold God and Goddess of Creation and Destruction, the Moonmother and Sunfather, the Heart of the Void, the Eternal Fire, Spearsinger, Shieldbreaker, Poet of Promises, Dreamer in Dark Places. Every race and nation has a different name for the Former, but all know Yir as the awesome birther of existence, and all other gods that followed. Yir's principal Domain is LIGHT, though Yir technically holds Dominion over all things. Yir is worshiped by architects, dancers, philosophers, poets, and certain soldiers and nobles. Elves count amongst Yir's most numerous worshipers, and gave them the titles of Poet of Promises and Dreamer in Dark Places. Dwarves and gnomes come next, with the titles Spearsinger and Shieldbreaker. Humans do not usually choose Yir as a hearth god, instead respectfully acknowledging their sovereignty over all other deities and creation, a responsibility which Yir accepts with dubious and bemused grace. Yir is the god of balance, duality, and the cosmos; from their shoulders hang the stars, and the phases of the moon are their circlet. Rings of other celestial bodies are their belt and robes.</p>
			<p>From Yir's dreams, from the sparks of the Moonspear and the glimmer of the Sunshield, came their first children. Verida came first, and represented the Divine Flame's ability to create anew. To burn away fear, lies, pain, and darkness. To provide light and warmth, to forge tools and raise houses, the sweet-smelling incense, the fragrant herb, crackling meat upon the welcoming hearth. He took up the Sunshield, and his hair burst in to triumphant flame. Next came Tulo, and represented the Divine Flame's ability to break down. To burn away restraint, order, despair, and tyranny. To provide terrible heat and blinding light, to forge weapons and armor, the burning tower, the molten flesh offered up in ecstatic supplication, fields burned down to make way for the next harvest. She took up the Moonspear, and her eyes glowed with transcendent silver light.</p>
			<p>Verida and Tulo looked upon each in shock for a millennia. Then, finding disgust in one another, they fought for ten millennia. Realizing that their disgust was unwarranted, and that each completed the other, they laid together for a hundred thousand. From their conflict, and their coupling, was Creation completed, its vastness filled with life, its corners lurking with death. From their heaving and sweating bodies crawled all manner of living things, and from their gasping breath did they breath magic, artistry, and lust for rulership and conquest in to these beings. So were born the Celestials, the Fiends, and all Primordial creatures.</p>
			
			<h3>Verida, Life Domain</h3>
			<p>Verida, who has Dominion over LIFE, is the God of the Sun, the God of Kings, the Lord of the Morning, the Dawn Triumphant, Sunfather, Blessed Son. He is masculinity personified, long of arm and leg, broad of chest, chiseled features, golden tresses glowing with the fury of a thousand suns. On his arm he bears the Sunshield, which burns away all lies and doubt, and which protects him and his followers from all manner of harm and misdeeds. He is a solemn and even-natured deity, a god of tender mercy but stern judgement. His followers are his children, servants, and loyal subjects. Verida is the god of community, family, loyal service and lawful rulership. As such he is worshiped by all manner of kings, nobles, and knights, and to a lesser extent by farmers and guards. Verida is acknowledged as the premier god of humanity, their protector and judge. Dwarves, dragonborn, and other organized, goodly beings do him homage as well.</p>
			
			<h3>Tulo, Death Domain</h3>
			<p>Tulo, who has Dominion over DEATH, is the Goddess of the Moon, the Everchanging Darkness, Queen in the Night, the Bloody Mother, Steel Sister, the Taker and the Holder of Hands. She is the mother of all ancient beings both beautiful and terrible; angels have suckled from her perfect breasts, devils borne from her curving hips. Tulo dances upon the twilight razor that separates Creation from the Void. In her hands she wields the Moonspear, which cuts to the bitter heart of any matter. She abhors tradition and exults in chaos, encouraging her worshipers to tear down establishments, to revel in torchlit darkness. Burning cities are her favorite offerings, sex and battle her preferred prayers. Tulo is the goddess of the underworld, and she loves all things dark, broken, and painful. She is worshiped by assassins, berserkers, hedonists, necromancers, rebels, and the mad. Tieflings, half-orcs, and other outcast, renegade beings do her homage as well.</p>
			<p>From the passions and conflicts of Verida and Tulo came four more children. Vitality ran from their forms like water, filling in what little cracks of Creation were as yet untouched. These children each retreated in fear and wonder from one another, each selecting a corner of creation to call their own. Only after one thousand thousand years did they reconvene, under the watchful eyes of Yir. Around them flocked the original children of Verida and Tulo, who in these new gods they saw worthy rulers.</p>
			
			<h3>Deneth, Knowledge</h3>
			<p>Deneth, who has Dominion over KNOWLEDGE, is the God of Magic, the Practitioner, the Silent Lord, the Elder Serpent, Wasteminder, Voidgazer. A mysterious and oftentimes malevolent deity, swathed in robes of crimson, yellow, or purple as the mood takes him; his face is always either a terrible nothingness, or a monstrous visage of tentacles, chitin, and dripping slime. Deneth has long dwelt on the edge of Creation, seeking to know the unknowable, staring long and thoughtfully in to the endless and nameless Void. In his gloved hands there is always a book and pen, jotting down his studies; he is surrounding by the innumerable souls of archaeologists, historians, scribes, warlocks, and wizards, who sold their immortal service to him in return for unfathomable knowledge in life. Deneth knows all mysteries and secrets; the weight of this knowledge is enough to shatter the minds of most mortals who possess the hubris or insatiable knowledge to know them. A bleak and morbid god, given to nihilistic moods and spiteful humors.</p>
			
			<h3>Belega, Tempests</h3>
			<p>Belega, who has Dominion over TEMPESTS, is the God of Storms, the Lightning Shark, Deep Dreamer, Omenspeaker, Rumbler, Ravenwind. He wears robes of kelp and nets, interwoven with his floorlength chaotic green and blue beard. Belega's voice and temperament are constantly changing like the wind and seas he loves; one moment he is still water, serene and immovable. The next he is the raging storm, punishing his followers for the slightest misdeed. Belega is the god of prophecy, who sees innumerable futures and fates for gods and mortals alike. To the astronomers, farmers, fisherfolk, sailors, and marauders who worship him, he brings both calamity and fortune, and woe betide any who misinterpret his mercurial moods. All races who live near exclusively in the sea revere him, though to some he preaches bloody conquest, to others bold exploration, and others still careful mercantile ventures.</p>
			
			<h3>Mios, Trickery</h3>
			<p>Mios, who has Dominion over TRICKERY, is the Goddess of Tales, the Spinning Coin, Miss Fortune, Webspinner, Coyote Maiden. She prefers a battered old-hat and a faded poncho, her features obscured but for one gleaming eye and a brilliant, almost savage grin. Mios wanders Creation in many guises, telling stories, weaving outrageous yarns, and tricking gods, monsters, and mortals out of their trinkets and their pride. She believes in quiet and cheerful courage, outsmarting those stronger than you, and educating the rich and powerful in the meaning of charity and humility, often with a quick eye and steady hand. Bards are her favorite servants, and she has a soft spot for all entertainers, explorers, merchants, and ne'er-do-wells. Halflings number among her most numerous followers, as do gnomes, goblins, and kobolds, but all portray her in slightly different lights.</p>
			
			<h3>Orgoth, War</h3>
			<p>Orgoth, who has Dominion over WAR, is the God of Conflict, Courage in Crisis, the Purpose in the Pain, Redhand, Old Tusk, Clovenhelm. He typically has two appearances; bloated and stocky, folds of fat spilling out of bronze platemail; or a figure gaunt and haggard with disease, soulless eyes staring out of a tortured visage. Orgoth teaches us of the horrors of war, but does not exalt them. He despises cowardice and cruelty, and takes great delight in punishing desertion, rape, and wanton destruction. Honored warriors slain in noble battle may feast and fight by his side for all time, as do the innocent victims of craven crimes. It is said that Orgoth created both the orcs and the gnolls to test the other races' mettle; if so, they have largely strayed from his teachings and philosophy. Orgoth is worshiped primarily by soldiers, but is also the patron and protector of doctors, caravaneers, heralds, and pilgrims.</p>
			
			<h3>Zan, Nature</h3>
			<p>Zan, who has Dominion over NATURE, is the Goddess of Harmony, the Rain Runner, the Harvester of Sorrow, She Who Watches, One From Many, Red Reaper. Zan's appearance changes with the seasons, her hair and eyes shifting from green, to gold, to red, to silver, and back again, though she never loses her solemn smile and rough-worn hands. Zan is the goddess of agriculture, fertility, hunting, and the breeding and riding of beasts. She expects her followers to live as one with the land, understanding that they need its fruits to survive. But her wrath is terrible against those that despoil her gifts. Zan is the creator of all blights and disease, of all things that swarm and devour to survive. She is the patron of the elves and all sylvan beings, who are her champions and most beloved servants; the drow are but one of the few races to have suffered divine punishment at her hands.</p>

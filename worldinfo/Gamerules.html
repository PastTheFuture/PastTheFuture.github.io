			1.) No backstabbing or player deals behind the party's back, we are all in this together.
			2.) Money will be valuable in the campaign, as while we are in the boonies of civilization, there is an economy. One that we are mostly gonna contribute too. If we find a magic item, and cant use it or don't want it, it will be sold at the local Magic item shop, and those items can be bought by other players. 
			3.) Players will only see a 2 level difference between characters, as to make sure some people cant just shoot up so unfathomably high in level. 
			4.) The map is editable by everyone, just try not to draw dicks everywhere, like you are Jonah Hill from Superbad. Schyler will be mad.
